            <p><b>Cricket</b> originated in the rural areas of south-east 
                England during the <u>Middle Ages</u>, with the earliest 
                definite record dating back to the late 16 <sup>th </sup> th century</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Background</li>
                <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of <u>eleven players</u> each,
                     on a field with a 22-yard pitch at its center. 
                     The game's primary objective is to score more runs than the opposing team. 
                     Cricket has a rich history, dating back to the late 16th century in England,
                      and has evolved significantly over the centuries</p>
                <li>Foundation</li>
                <p>A cricket foundation can refer to various organizations involved
                     in promoting and supporting the sport of cricket.
                      This can include foundations focused on developing young talent,
                       providing coaching and training, or supporting
                     the overall growth of cricket within a community or region.</p>
                <li>Expansions and termination</li>
                <p>Cricket has seen both expansion and termination of teams, leagues, and even
                     governing bodies throughout its history. <b>The International Cricket Council (ICC)</b>
                      and various national boards have been involved in these processes, often due to 
                      financial issues, governance problems, or contractual disputes. </p>

                <li>Tournament format</li>
                <p>==>Test Matches: The longest format, typically lasting up to five days, where each team bats and bowls in two innings.<br>
               ==>One Day Internationals (ODIs): Limited to 50 overs per side, completed in a single day, balancing strategy and aggressive batting.<br>

                 <li>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</li>
                 <p>In cricket, player acquisition, squad composition, and salaries 
                    are key aspects of team management, especially in leagues like the IPL.
                     Teams acquire players through auctions, trades, and replacements. 
                     Squads are built with a mix of skilled batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders
                      to ensure a balanced team.</p>
                  <li>Match rules</li>
                  <p> The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running
                     between the wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss 
                     the batsmen and restrict their scoring. The team with the most runs
                      at the end of the match wins. </p>
                   <li>Prize money</li>
                   <p>Cricket tournaments offer substantial prize money for winning teams
                     and individuals, both at the international and domestic levels.
                      The International Cricket Council (ICC) sets prize money 
                      for its global events, while individual cricket boards, 
                      like the Board of Control for Cricket in India<strong>(BCCI)</strong> ,
                       also offer rewards for their national teams and domestic tournaments. </p>
